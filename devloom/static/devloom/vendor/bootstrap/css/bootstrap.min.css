/* Bootstrap placeholder

This file is a small placeholder so the project has a local path for a vendored Bootstrap copy.
To fully vendor Bootstrap, replace this file with the real minified Bootstrap CSS (e.g., download from
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.2/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css and save it here).

Keeping a local copy improves stability for offline development and reproducible builds.
