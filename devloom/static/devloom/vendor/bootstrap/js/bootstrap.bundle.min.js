/* Bootstrap JS placeholder

Replace this file with the real `bootstrap.bundle.min.js` (includes Popper) downloaded from
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.2/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js

This placeholder prevents missing-file errors during development; it does not implement Bootstrap's JS.

console.warn('Bootstrap bundle placeholder loaded. For full functionality, replace with real bootstrap.bundle.min.js');
